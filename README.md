## Case Study 3

### Context: 
Every company wants to succeed and gain an edge on the competition. Achieving the revenue goals translates into maximizing sales. Many companies distribute their goods at physical Point Of Sales (POSs). For all of them the challenge is to devise a strategy that will drive the sales at POSs. Possible solution could be to place the product in the most convenient location for consumers. In this assignment, we will ask you to figure out what surroundings and respective amenities lead to top POS performance.

For performing this analysis, please use following data sources:
* `sales_granular.csv` - contains information about the sales volumes of a product at particular POS; each POS is uniquely identified by 'store_code'.
* `Surroundings.json` - contains information about 90 different amenities (restaurants, shops, beauty salons etc.) that are in the surroundings of each POS.

Both data sets are available for download here:

Using the data from `sales_granular.csv` create a target variable, to be used for modelling.

It is up to you to decide:
*	how you design the target variable
*	what timeframe you use to calculate the target variable
*	if you want to treat it as a classification or regression problem
Using the data from 'Surroundings.json' file, prepare a dataset with exploratory variables to be uses for modeling.
The goal is to create a model that identifies important attributes in the surroundings that impact sales.

### Objectives:
Please prepare the presentation with your results. In it, you'll have to justify and explain:
*	How did you create the target variable?
*	How did you prepare the final dataset for modeling?
*	How did you split datasets into training and testing?
*	What methods did you use for modelling and why?
*	How did you quantify the performance of your model(s)?
You need to be ready to explain all the assumptions that you made.
Together with your presentation (in PDF) you'll need to provide us with your source code written in Python. Please share it with us via GitHub.
